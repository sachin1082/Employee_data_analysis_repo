# 🧑‍💼 Employee Data Analysis Project

## 📊 Overview
This project analyzes employee data to uncover insights about workforce demographics, salary distribution, performance trends, and attrition patterns. It uses Python for data cleaning, feature engineering, and visualization, making it a strong portfolio piece for HR analytics and data science.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **NumPy** for numerical operations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook / VS Code**
- **Excel dataset** (`employee_data.xlsx`)

## 📁 Files Included
- `employee_data_analysis.ipynb` – Main analysis notebook
- `employee_data.xlsx` – Raw dataset
- `README.md` – Project summary and instructions

## 🔍 Key Features
- Cleaned and standardized column names
- Handled missing values (median for numeric, mode for categorical)
- Converted `hire_date` to datetime and calculated `tenure_years`
- Visualized:
  - Employee count per department
  - Salary distribution and department-wise comparison
  - Performance vs income scatterplot
  - Gender distribution (pie chart)
  - Attrition by department (stacked bar chart)
  - Age distribution
  - Correlation heatmap of numeric features

## 📈 Sample Insights
- Departments with highest employee counts
- Salary variation across departments
- Relationship between performance scores and income
- Gender ratio and age demographics
- Attrition trends across departments

## 🚀 How to Run
